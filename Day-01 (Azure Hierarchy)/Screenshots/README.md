# Day 01 â€“ Azure Hierarchy

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- Learned how to **move resources** between Resource Groups
- Explored differences between **RG-Test-India** and **RG-Test-US** resource groups

## ðŸ§ª Practical Steps Performed
1. Viewed the list of resource groups
2. Checked subscriptions
3. Moved resources from `RG-Test-US` to `RG-Test-India`
4. Verified changes in the portal and confirmed using PowerShell
